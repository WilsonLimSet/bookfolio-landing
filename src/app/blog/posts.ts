      "Looking for a modern Goodreads alternative? Bookfolio lets you rank books head-to-head, build visual rankings, and compare taste with friends.",
    date: "February 6, 2026",
    content: `
If you've been using Goodreads, you know the frustration. The interface feels stuck in 2010, star ratings don't capture how you really feel about books, and comparing your taste with friends is basically impossible. That's why we built Bookfolio.

## What makes Bookfolio different from Goodreads?

**Head-to-head ranking, not star ratings.** Instead of assigning arbitrary stars, Bookfolio asks you a simple question: which of these two books did you like more? Through a series of quick comparisons, your true ranking emerges naturally. No more agonizing over whether a book is a 3 or a 4.

**Visual book rankings.** Your ranked list isn't just a number — it's a beautiful, shareable profile that shows exactly where every book stands. See your #1 of all time right next to your most recent read.

**Compare with friends.** Follow other readers and see how your rankings stack up. Did you both love the same book? Did one of you rank it #3 while the other put it at #47? That's where the interesting conversations start.

**Modern, fast interface.** Bookfolio is built with modern web technology. No page refreshes, no clunky forms. Just a smooth, responsive experience on any device.

## Who is Bookfolio for?

Bookfolio is for anyone who reads and wants more than a simple "did you like it?" rating system. Whether you read 5 books a year or 50, the ranking system works. It's especially great if you enjoy discussing books with friends and want a concrete way to compare taste.

## Ready to Switch?

Getting started takes less than a minute. Search for a book, start ranking, and watch your reading profile take shape. Your future self will thank you for having a definitive answer to "what's your favorite book?"

    description:
      "Love how Beli lets you rank restaurants? Bookfolio brings the same head-to-head ranking experience to books.",
    date: "February 6, 2026",
    content: `
If you use Beli to rank restaurants, you already know the magic of head-to-head comparisons. Instead of slapping a star rating on every meal, you compare two restaurants and pick a winner. Over time, your true ranking reveals itself. Bookfolio does the exact same thing — but for books.

## The Ranking System You Already Love

The concept is simple and addictive. Finished a book? Bookfolio shows you two books and asks: which one did you prefer? A few quick picks later, your new read slots perfectly into your all-time ranking. No overthinking. No number anxiety. Just honest comparisons.

## Why does ranking work better than star ratings?

Star ratings are broken. A 4-star book could mean "really enjoyed it" or "it was fine, I guess." When you compare two books directly, there's no ambiguity. You either preferred one or the other. The result is a ranking that genuinely reflects your taste.

## Social Comparison

Just like Beli lets you see how your restaurant taste compares with friends, Bookfolio shows you where you agree and disagree on books. Follow friends, see their rankings, and discover your next read through people whose taste you trust — not an algorithm.

## From Restaurants to Books

If you're the kind of person who ranks restaurants on Beli, you're going to love ranking books on Bookfolio. The satisfying feeling of seeing your list take shape, the debates with friends about rankings, the joy of discovering that your #1 is someone else's #50 — it all translates perfectly.

Start ranking your books today and see where your favorites really stand.

    description:
      "Tired of Goodreads? Here are 5 reasons readers are switching to Bookfolio for tracking and ranking their books.",
    date: "February 6, 2026",
    content: `
Goodreads has been the default book tracking app for over a decade. But defaults aren't always best. Here's why more readers are making the switch to Bookfolio.

## 1. Rankings Beat Ratings

Goodreads asks "how many stars?" Bookfolio asks "which book did you like more?" The difference is huge. Rankings give you a definitive ordered list of every book you've read. No ties, no ambiguity. When someone asks for your top 5, you'll actually have an answer.

## 2. A Modern Experience

Goodreads hasn't meaningfully updated its design in years. Bookfolio is built for 2026 — fast, responsive, and a pleasure to use on your phone. Animations are smooth, pages load instantly, and the interface gets out of your way.

## 3. Better Social Features

On Goodreads, social features feel like an afterthought. On Bookfolio, they're core to the experience. Follow friends, see their rankings in your feed, compare your lists side-by-side, and discover what the readers you trust are reading.

## 4. Your Reading Identity

Your Bookfolio profile is a visual representation of your reading taste. It's shareable, it's interesting to browse, and it tells people more about you than a list of star ratings ever could. Your #1 book says something meaningful.

## 5. Active Development

Goodreads is famously stagnant. Bookfolio is actively developed with new features shipping regularly. We listen to our users and build what readers actually want.

## Making the Switch

You don't have to abandon Goodreads overnight. Start by ranking a few books on Bookfolio and see how the experience feels. Most people find that once they start ranking, they don't want to go back to stars.

    description:
      "Learn how head-to-head book ranking works and why it's a more accurate way to track and remember the books you've read.",
    date: "February 6, 2026",
    content: `
We've all been there. Someone asks "what's your favorite book?" and your mind goes blank. You've read hundreds of books, but ranking them feels impossible. That's because you've never had the right tool.

## What's wrong with traditional book tracking?

Most book tracking apps give you two options: a binary "read/not read" or a star rating. Neither captures how you really feel. A 4-star rating for a thriller and a 4-star rating for a memoir tell you nothing about which one you preferred. And six months later, you won't remember why you gave either of them 4 stars.

## How does head-to-head book ranking work?

Bookfolio uses a comparison-based ranking system. When you finish a book, you're shown pairs of books you've already read and asked which you preferred. Through a series of these quick, intuitive comparisons, your new book finds its perfect spot in your ranked list.

The beauty is in the simplicity. You never have to think about numbers. You just answer one question at a time: "Did I like Book A or Book B more?"

## Why Rankings Stick

Rankings create stronger memories than ratings. When you know that a book is your #7 all-time, sandwiched between two specific other books, you remember it differently. The ranking gives it context. You remember why it's above #8 and below #6. That context is what star ratings can never provide.

## Getting Started

1. **Search for a book** you've recently read
2. **Start ranking** by comparing it against other books
3. **Watch your list grow** as you add more books
4. **Share your profile** and see how friends compare

The more books you rank, the more accurate and interesting your list becomes. Start with 5-10 books and you'll immediately see the value.

    date: "February 6, 2026",

With more book tracking options than ever, choosing the right one matters. Here's an honest look at the three most popular options.

## Goodreads

**The veteran.** Goodreads has the largest community and the most comprehensive book database. It's great if you want to see what everyone is reading and participate in reading challenges.

**Pros:** Huge community, reading challenges, comprehensive database, author pages.

**Cons:** Outdated interface, star ratings feel imprecise, social features are clunky, owned by Amazon which concerns some readers.

## StoryGraph

**The stats nerd.** StoryGraph is built for readers who love data. It tracks your reading moods, pacing preferences, and gives detailed statistics about your reading habits.

**Pros:** Beautiful statistics, mood and pace tracking, no Amazon ownership, good recommendation engine.

**Cons:** Smaller community, still uses star/half-star ratings, less focus on social comparison.

## Bookfolio

**The ranker.** Bookfolio replaces star ratings with head-to-head comparisons. Instead of guessing a number, you compare two books and pick a favorite. The result is a definitive ranked list of every book you've read.

**Pros:** Unique ranking system, visual profiles, direct friend comparison, modern fast interface, actively developed.

**Cons:** Newer platform with a growing community, focused on ranking rather than reading statistics.

## Which book tracking app should you choose?

- **Choose Goodreads** if community size and reading challenges are your priority.
- **Choose StoryGraph** if you love reading statistics and mood tracking.
- **Choose Bookfolio** if you want a definitive ranking of your books and love comparing taste with friends.

Many readers use more than one. But if you've ever struggled to answer "what's your favorite book?" — Bookfolio is the one that will finally give you an answer.

    date: "February 6, 2026",
    content: `
2025 was an incredible year for fiction. From debut novelists to returning favorites, readers were spoiled for choice. Here are the 10 fiction books that stood out above the rest — ranked by the readers themselves.

## 1. Intermezzo by Sally Rooney

Sally Rooney's fourth novel cemented her status as the defining voice of millennial fiction. Intermezzo follows two brothers grieving their father's death, exploring how loss reshapes relationships. Rooney's trademark dialogue is sharper than ever, and the emotional depth here surpasses her earlier work.

## 2. James by Percival Everett

A retelling of Huckleberry Finn from Jim's perspective, James is both a literary triumph and a vital reimagining of an American classic. Everett's prose is precise, funny, and devastating in equal measure. It won the Pulitzer Prize and deserved every bit of the acclaim.

## 3. The God of the Woods by Liz Moore

Liz Moore delivered a sprawling, atmospheric mystery set in the Adirondacks that weaves together multiple timelines and perspectives. It's the kind of novel you cancel plans to finish — a genuine page-turner with literary heft.

## 4. All Fours by Miranda July

Miranda July's second novel is unlike anything else published this year. A woman on a road trip that never quite happens, exploring desire, aging, and identity. It's weird, honest, and completely unforgettable. You'll either love it or be bewildered by it — possibly both.

## 5. The Women by Kristin Hannah

Kristin Hannah brought the Vietnam War era to life through the eyes of Army nurses. The Women is sweeping historical fiction at its best — deeply researched, emotionally gutting, and impossible to put down.

## 6. Orbital by Samantha Harvey

Winner of the Booker Prize, Orbital follows six astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station over a single day. It's meditative, beautiful, and offers a perspective on Earth and humanity that feels genuinely new. Short but unforgettable.

## 7. Creation Lake by Rachel Kushner

Rachel Kushner's spy novel about an American agent infiltrating a French commune is both a taut thriller and a philosophical meditation on civilization. The dual narrative — modern espionage and prehistoric philosophy — shouldn't work but absolutely does.

## 8. The Large Glass by Adam Thirlwell

Thirlwell's ambitious novel about art, translation, and the impossibility of originality is a puzzle box that rewards patient readers. It's playful, erudite, and occasionally maddening in the best way.

## 9. Colored Television by Danzy Senna

A Hollywood satire about a biracial writer trying to sell a TV show while her personal life implodes. Senna skewers the entertainment industry's relationship with race and identity with razor-sharp wit and genuine emotional stakes.

## 10. Small Things Like These by Claire Keegan

Originally published in 2021 but reaching peak popularity in 2025 after its film adaptation, Keegan's novella about a coal merchant in 1980s Ireland confronting the Magdalene laundries remains a masterclass in compression. Every sentence carries weight.

## 1. Revenge of the Tipping Point by Malcolm Gladwell

Gladwell returned to the concept that made him famous, but this time examining how tipping points can go wrong. From epidemics to financial crises, he explores the dark side of social contagion. Vintage Gladwell — accessible, provocative, and impossible to summarize at dinner without people wanting to read it themselves.

## 2. The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt

Jonathan Haidt's examination of how smartphones and social media rewired childhood became the most discussed non-fiction book of the year. Whether you agree with all his conclusions or not, the data is compelling and the conversation it sparked was overdue.

## 3. Nexus by Yuval Noah Harari

Harari's exploration of information networks throughout human history — from ancient myths to AI — is his most focused and urgent book yet. It's a framework for understanding how stories and data shape civilizations, and why the current information revolution is different from all previous ones.

## 4. Be Ready When the Luck Happens by Ina Garten

The Barefoot Contessa's memoir was the feel-good book of the year. Ina Garten's journey from nuclear policy analyst to beloved cookbook author is told with warmth, humor, and surprising candor. It's comfort reading at its finest.

## 5. Patriot by Alexei Navalny

Published posthumously, Navalny's memoir is both a political document and a deeply human story. Written largely from prison, it chronicles his fight against corruption in Russia with remarkable wit and courage. Essential reading for understanding modern authoritarianism.

## 6. Supercommunicators by Charles Duhigg

Duhigg's deep dive into what makes some people extraordinary communicators is packed with practical insights. It's the rare self-improvement book that's backed by rigorous research and doesn't feel like it's trying to sell you something.

## 7. The Wager by David Grann

David Grann turned an 18th-century shipwreck and mutiny into a gripping narrative that reads like a thriller. The Wager is a story about survival, truth, and how history gets written by whoever makes it home first.

## 8. Slow Productivity by Cal Newport

Cal Newport challenged the cult of busyness with a manifesto for doing fewer things, working at a natural pace, and obsessing over quality. In an era of burnout, this book felt like permission to breathe.

## 9. Same as Ever by Morgan Housel

The author of The Psychology of Money returned with a book about the things that never change. While everyone obsesses over predictions, Housel argues the real insights come from understanding timeless patterns of human behavior. Short chapters, big ideas.

Biographies and memoirs had a banner year in 2025. These are the life stories that captivated readers and earned the highest rankings.

## 1. Be Ready When the Luck Happens by Ina Garten

Ina Garten's memoir dominated bestseller lists for good reason. Her story — from government work to becoming a culinary icon — is told with the same warmth that makes her show so beloved. The chapters about her marriage to Jeffrey are genuinely moving.

## 2. Patriot by Alexei Navalny

Written from a Russian prison cell, Navalny's memoir is extraordinary. His humor in the face of persecution, his clarity about corruption, and the tragic context of his death make this one of the most important memoirs of the decade.

## 3. Bits and Pieces by Whoopi Goldberg

Whoopi Goldberg's meditation on loss, grief, and the objects we hold onto after people are gone is surprisingly intimate. It's short, honest, and avoids the usual celebrity memoir formula entirely.

## 4. The Light We Carry by Michelle Obama

Michelle Obama followed up Becoming with reflections on navigating change and uncertainty. It's part memoir, part practical wisdom, and her voice is as warm and relatable as ever.

## 5. Knife by Salman Rushdie

Rushdie's account of the 2022 attack that nearly killed him is harrowing and defiant. He writes about trauma, recovery, and the meaning of free expression with a novelist's eye for detail and a survivor's hard-won perspective.

## 6. The Demon of Unrest by Erik Larson

Erik Larson returned to his signature blend of narrative history and biography, this time covering the months between Lincoln's election and the start of the Civil War. It reads like a thriller even though you know how it ends.

## 7. Sonny Boy by Al Pacino

Al Pacino's long-awaited memoir is messy, digressive, and completely captivating — much like the man himself. From his Bronx childhood to the heights of Hollywood, it's an unfiltered look at one of cinema's greatest actors.

## 8. You Never Know by Tom Selleck

Tom Selleck's autobiography surprised readers with its depth and humility. Behind the mustache is a thoughtful, funny storyteller with more range than anyone expected.

## 9. Woodbine by Jamie Harrison

A quiet, literary memoir about family, place, and memory in Montana. Harrison writes with the precision and beauty of her father, Jim Harrison, exploring what it means to inherit a legacy of storytelling.

If you love books that keep you up past midnight, 2025 delivered. Here are the thrillers and mysteries that readers ranked as the best of the year.

## 1. The God of the Woods by Liz Moore

Set in the Adirondacks across multiple timelines, The God of the Woods is the rare thriller that's also genuine literature. Two children disappear from a summer camp decades apart, and the mystery unfolds through perspectives that each reveal a new piece of the puzzle.

## 2. The Women in the Walls by Amy Lukavics

A gothic thriller about a girl living in her family's mansion who becomes convinced her missing aunt is trapped in the walls. Atmospheric, creepy, and unpredictable in the best way.

## 3. Eruption by Michael Crichton and James Patterson

A posthumous Michael Crichton novel completed by James Patterson, Eruption combines volcanic disaster with a military conspiracy. It's pure entertainment — fast-paced, high-concept, and exactly what you want for a weekend read.

## 4. The House of Doors by Tan Twan Eng

Set in colonial Malaya, this literary thriller weaves together the story of W. Somerset Maugham's visit with a local woman's dangerous secret. It's atmospheric, layered, and builds to a devastating conclusion.

## 5. All the Colors of the Dark by Chris Whitaker

Chris Whitaker followed up We Begin at the End with an ambitious thriller spanning decades and continents. A kidnapping, a serial killer, and interconnected stories that come together in ways you won't see coming.

## 6. The Midnight Feast by Lucy Foley

Lucy Foley set her latest locked-room mystery at the grand opening of a luxury resort built on land with a dark history. The multiple perspectives and escalating tension are perfectly calibrated. Peak beach-read thriller.

## 7. The Paris Novel by Ruth Reichl

Part mystery, part love letter to Paris, part food writing — Ruth Reichl's novel follows a woman who inherits a Paris apartment and discovers secrets that change everything she knew about her family.

## 8. Death Valley by Melissa Broder

While more literary horror than traditional thriller, Death Valley's unsettling story of a woman who finds a mysterious canyon while her husband is in the ICU will haunt you. It's short, intense, and deeply strange.

## 9. The Frozen River by Ariel Lawhon

Based on the true story of a colonial midwife who investigates a murder, The Frozen River is historical mystery at its finest. The setting — 1789 Maine — is vividly rendered, and the central mystery is compelling.

## 10. Listen for the Lie by Amy Tintera

A true-crime podcast reopens a cold case, forcing the prime suspect to confront what really happened the night her best friend died. The dual narrative of past and present is addictive, and the ending genuinely surprises.

Fantasy and sci-fi readers had a stacked year in 2025. From epic series finales to bold standalone novels, these are the books that captured imaginations and earned top rankings.

## 1. Wind and Truth by Brandon Sanderson

The fifth Stormlight Archive book lived up to a decade of expectations. Sanderson delivered a massive, satisfying installment that advanced every major plotline while still finding room for the intimate character moments that make the series work.

## 2. The Familiar by Leigh Bardugo

Leigh Bardugo stepped away from the Grishaverse for a standalone set in Golden Age Spain. A servant with a hidden magical gift navigates the dangerous politics of the Spanish court. It's darker and more literary than her YA work, and the result is her best book yet.

## 3. The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley

A genre-defying debut that blends time travel, romance, and political satire. A bureaucrat in a near-future Britain is assigned to help a Victorian naval officer adjust to modern life. It's funny, smart, romantic, and surprisingly moving.

## 4. Service Model by Adrian Tchaikovsky

Tchaikovsky's satirical sci-fi about a robot butler who accidentally kills his owner and goes on a journey through a post-apocalyptic landscape is both hilarious and thought-provoking. It's Jeeves and Wooster meets The Road, and somehow it works.

## 5. The Book of Bill by Alex Hirsch

The creator of Gravity Falls delivered a wild, meta, in-universe book written from the perspective of the show's villain. It's packed with puzzles, lore, and the kind of creative ambition that made the show a phenomenon.

## 6. House of Flame and Shadow by Sarah J. Maas

The third Crescent City novel brought the series to a multiverse-spanning conclusion that connected all of Maas's fictional worlds. Fans of the series ranked it among her most ambitious and satisfying work.

## 7. The Mercy of Gods by James S.A. Corey

The Expanse authors started a new space opera series with a novel about humanity under alien occupation. It's a slower burn than their previous work, but the worldbuilding is extraordinary and the setup promises great things to come.

## 8. Starter Villain by John Scalzi

Scalzi's comedic sci-fi about a man who inherits his uncle's supervillain business is pure fun. Talking cats, corporate espionage, and a surprisingly touching story about finding your place in the world.

## 9. The Frugal Wizard's Handbook for Surviving Medieval England by Brandon Sanderson

Sanderson's secret project novella is a lighthearted romp — a man wakes up in medieval England with no memory and a handbook that's mostly useless. It's shorter and breezier than his epic fantasy, and a great entry point for new readers.

## 10. Emily Wilde's Map of the Otherlands by Heather Fawcett

The sequel to Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Faeries continues the adventures of the delightfully prickly faerie scholar. It's cozy fantasy with real stakes, and the slow-burn romance is perfectly paced.

The self-help genre is flooded with noise. These are the 2025 books that readers ranked as genuinely useful — the ones that actually shift your perspective rather than just restating obvious advice.

## 1. Slow Productivity by Cal Newport

Cal Newport made the case for doing less, better. In a world obsessed with output and hustle, Slow Productivity argues for working at a natural pace, focusing on fewer projects, and obsessing over quality. It's the antidote to burnout culture.

## 2. Supercommunicators by Charles Duhigg

Duhigg decoded what makes some people exceptional at connecting with others. The key insight — that every conversation is actually one of three types, and matching the type is what creates understanding — is both simple and transformative.

## 3. The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt

While technically social science, Haidt's book gave parents and educators a framework for understanding and addressing the youth mental health crisis. The practical recommendations — especially around phone-free schools — sparked real policy changes.

## 4. Same as Ever by Morgan Housel

Instead of predictions, Housel focused on the things that never change about human behavior. Greed, fear, optimism, risk — the patterns that repeat across centuries. It's the rare book that gets more useful over time.

## 5. Outlive by Peter Attia

Dr. Attia's comprehensive guide to longevity is the most actionable health book in years. It covers exercise, nutrition, sleep, and emotional health with the depth of a medical textbook but the readability of a conversation with a very smart friend.

## 6. Good Inside by Dr. Becky Kennedy

Dr. Becky's parenting book resonated far beyond parents. Her framework — that people are "good inside" even when their behavior isn't — applies to every relationship. It's empathy made practical.

## 7. Buy Back Your Time by Dan Martell

A counterintuitive guide to scaling yourself by auditing how you spend your time and systematically buying back hours spent on low-value tasks. Practical, specific, and especially useful for entrepreneurs.

## 8. Hidden Potential by Adam Grant

Adam Grant challenged the cult of natural talent, arguing that character skills — like the ability to absorb information, manage emotions, and embrace discomfort — matter more than raw ability. Backed by research and full of surprising examples.

## 9. Feel Good Productivity by Ali Abdaal

Ali Abdaal's debut book argues that the path to productivity isn't discipline — it's finding ways to enjoy the process. It's lighter than most productivity books and refreshingly honest about what actually works.

## 10. Meditations for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman

The author of Four Thousand Weeks returned with daily meditations on accepting our limitations and making the most of our finite time. It's philosophy made practical, one day at a time.

Romance had a massive year in 2025. BookTok kept the genre in the spotlight, but these books earned their rankings on pure quality. Here are the romance novels readers loved most.

## 1. Funny Story by Emily Henry

Emily Henry did it again. A woman moves in with her ex's ex after they're both dumped, and the forced proximity leads to... well, you know. But Henry's wit, emotional intelligence, and ability to make you feel everything elevate this far above the premise.

## 2. Just for the Summer by Abby Jimenez

Abby Jimenez continued her hot streak with a romance built on a hilarious curse — every person these two date goes on to find their soulmate. So they date each other to break the cycle. The banter is perfect and the emotions sneak up on you.

## 3. Wild Love by Elsie Silver

The first in Silver's Rose Hill series delivered small-town romance with characters who feel lived-in and real. The grumpy single dad and sunshine heroine dynamic is well-worn territory, but Silver makes it feel fresh.

## 4. The Paradise Problem by Christina Lauren

A fake marriage romance set at a lavish island resort. The writing duo's signature blend of humor and heat is fully on display, and the tropical setting adds a layer of escapist fun.

## 5. Not in Love by Ali Hazelwood

Ali Hazelwood brought her STEM-romance formula to a story about a biotechnology researcher and a venture capitalist on opposite sides of a corporate battle. It's enemies-to-lovers with actual professional stakes.

## 6. Bride by Ali Hazelwood

Hazelwood also delivered a paranormal romance about a vampire-werewolf political marriage that surprised fans of her contemporary work. It's darker, steamier, and shows impressive range.

## 7. The Reappearance of Rachel Price by Holly Jackson

While technically a thriller, the romantic subplot earned it a spot on many romance readers' ranked lists. The tension between the mystery and the love story is perfectly balanced.

## 8. Icebreaker by Hannah Grace

A figure skater and a hockey player navigate college athletics and each other. It's the sports romance that launched a thousand BookTok videos, and the chemistry is undeniable.

## 9. The Duke and I by Julia Quinn (Re-rank)

A perennial favorite that readers continued to rank highly in 2025, buoyed by the ongoing Bridgerton phenomenon. The original still holds up.

## 10. Happy Place by Emily Henry

Released in 2023 but still being discovered and ranked by new readers in 2025. The ex-couple pretending to still be together at a friend group vacation is Emily Henry at her most emotionally complex.

Every "must-read" list is subjective, but some books appear on almost all of them. Here are 50 books that consistently rank highest across readers — and how to actually make progress on reading them.

## The Classics

**To Kill a Mockingbird** by Harper Lee — Still the book most readers rank as essential. Its moral clarity resonates across generations.

**1984** by George Orwell — More relevant every year. Orwell's dystopia is the reference point for every conversation about surveillance and truth.

**Pride and Prejudice** by Jane Austen — The novel that invented the modern romance. Elizabeth Bennet remains one of fiction's greatest characters.

**The Great Gatsby** by F. Scott Fitzgerald — America in 200 pages. Short enough to read in a day, deep enough to think about for years.

**One Hundred Years of Solitude** by Gabriel Garcia Marquez — Magical realism at its peak. The Buendia family saga is unlike anything else in literature.

## Modern Essentials

**Sapiens** by Yuval Noah Harari — The book that reframes human history. Whether you agree with Harari or not, you'll think differently after reading it.

**Educated** by Tara Westover — A memoir about growing up survivalist and choosing education. Raw, honest, and unputdownable.

**The Kite Runner** by Khaled Hosseini — Friendship, betrayal, and redemption in Afghanistan. It hits you in the gut and stays there.

**Thinking, Fast and Slow** by Daniel Kahneman — The book that made behavioral economics mainstream. Dense but essential for understanding how we make decisions.

**The Alchemist** by Paulo Coelho — Love it or roll your eyes at it, there's a reason it's sold 150 million copies. Sometimes simple wisdom hits at the right time.

## Why a Ranked List Beats a Checklist

Most "books to read" lists are just checklists. You read them, mark them done, and forget about them. But when you rank them against each other, something interesting happens: you discover your actual literary taste.

Did you prefer 1984 or Brave New World? Is To Kill a Mockingbird above or below The Great Gatsby in your personal ranking? These comparisons reveal what kind of reader you are in a way that checkboxes never can.

## How to Get Started

Don't try to read all 50 at once. Pick 3-5 that interest you, read them, and rank them on Bookfolio. As you add more, your ranking evolves and becomes a genuine map of your reading journey. There's no rush — the books aren't going anywhere.

The goal isn't to finish the list. The goal is to discover what you love and build a reading identity that's uniquely yours.
