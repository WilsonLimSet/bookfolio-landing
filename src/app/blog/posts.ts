If you've been using Goodreads, you know the frustration. The interface feels stuck in 2010, star ratings don't capture how you really feel about books, and comparing your taste with friends is basically impossible. That's why we built Bookfolio.

## What Makes Bookfolio Different

**Head-to-head ranking, not star ratings.** Instead of assigning arbitrary stars, Bookfolio asks you a simple question: which of these two books did you like more? Through a series of quick comparisons, your true ranking emerges naturally. No more agonizing over whether a book is a 3 or a 4.

**Visual book rankings.** Your ranked list isn't just a number — it's a beautiful, shareable profile that shows exactly where every book stands. See your #1 of all time right next to your most recent read.

**Compare with friends.** Follow other readers and see how your rankings stack up. Did you both love the same book? Did one of you rank it #3 while the other put it at #47? That's where the interesting conversations start.

**Modern, fast interface.** Bookfolio is built with modern web technology. No page refreshes, no clunky forms. Just a smooth, responsive experience on any device.

## Who Is Bookfolio For?

Bookfolio is for anyone who reads and wants more than a simple "did you like it?" rating system. Whether you read 5 books a year or 50, the ranking system works. It's especially great if you enjoy discussing books with friends and want a concrete way to compare taste.

## Ready to Switch?

Getting started takes less than a minute. Search for a book, start ranking, and watch your reading profile take shape. Your future self will thank you for having a definitive answer to "what's your favorite book?"

      "Love how Beli lets you rank restaurants? Bookfolio brings the same head-to-head ranking experience to books.",
    date: "February 6, 2026",

If you use Beli to rank restaurants, you already know the magic of head-to-head comparisons. Instead of slapping a star rating on every meal, you compare two restaurants and pick a winner. Over time, your true ranking reveals itself. Bookfolio does the exact same thing — but for books.

## The Ranking System You Already Love

The concept is simple and addictive. Finished a book? Bookfolio shows you two books and asks: which one did you prefer? A few quick picks later, your new read slots perfectly into your all-time ranking. No overthinking. No number anxiety. Just honest comparisons.

## Why It Works Better Than Stars

Star ratings are broken. A 4-star book could mean "really enjoyed it" or "it was fine, I guess." When you compare two books directly, there's no ambiguity. You either preferred one or the other. The result is a ranking that genuinely reflects your taste.

## Social Comparison

Just like Beli lets you see how your restaurant taste compares with friends, Bookfolio shows you where you agree and disagree on books. Follow friends, see their rankings, and discover your next read through people whose taste you trust — not an algorithm.

## From Restaurants to Books

If you're the kind of person who ranks restaurants on Beli, you're going to love ranking books on Bookfolio. The satisfying feeling of seeing your list take shape, the debates with friends about rankings, the joy of discovering that your #1 is someone else's #50 — it all translates perfectly.

Start ranking your books today and see where your favorites really stand.

      "Tired of Goodreads? Here are 5 reasons readers are switching to Bookfolio for tracking and ranking their books.",
    date: "February 6, 2026",
    content: `
Goodreads has been the default book tracking app for over a decade. But defaults aren't always best. Here's why more readers are making the switch to Bookfolio.

## 1. Rankings Beat Ratings

Goodreads asks "how many stars?" Bookfolio asks "which book did you like more?" The difference is huge. Rankings give you a definitive ordered list of every book you've read. No ties, no ambiguity. When someone asks for your top 5, you'll actually have an answer.

## 2. A Modern Experience

Goodreads hasn't meaningfully updated its design in years. Bookfolio is built for 2026 — fast, responsive, and a pleasure to use on your phone. Animations are smooth, pages load instantly, and the interface gets out of your way.

## 3. Better Social Features

On Goodreads, social features feel like an afterthought. On Bookfolio, they're core to the experience. Follow friends, see their rankings in your feed, compare your lists side-by-side, and discover what the readers you trust are reading.

## 4. Your Reading Identity

Your Bookfolio profile is a visual representation of your reading taste. It's shareable, it's interesting to browse, and it tells people more about you than a list of star ratings ever could. Your #1 book says something meaningful.

## 5. Active Development

Goodreads is famously stagnant. Bookfolio is actively developed with new features shipping regularly. We listen to our users and build what readers actually want.

## Making the Switch

You don't have to abandon Goodreads overnight. Start by ranking a few books on Bookfolio and see how the experience feels. Most people find that once they start ranking, they don't want to go back to stars.

We've all been there. Someone asks "what's your favorite book?" and your mind goes blank. You've read hundreds of books, but ranking them feels impossible. That's because you've never had the right tool.

## The Problem with Traditional Book Tracking

Most book tracking apps give you two options: a binary "read/not read" or a star rating. Neither captures how you really feel. A 4-star rating for a thriller and a 4-star rating for a memoir tell you nothing about which one you preferred. And six months later, you won't remember why you gave either of them 4 stars.

## How Head-to-Head Ranking Works

Bookfolio uses a comparison-based ranking system. When you finish a book, you're shown pairs of books you've already read and asked which you preferred. Through a series of these quick, intuitive comparisons, your new book finds its perfect spot in your ranked list.

The beauty is in the simplicity. You never have to think about numbers. You just answer one question at a time: "Did I like Book A or Book B more?"

## Why Rankings Stick

Rankings create stronger memories than ratings. When you know that a book is your #7 all-time, sandwiched between two specific other books, you remember it differently. The ranking gives it context. You remember why it's above #8 and below #6. That context is what star ratings can never provide.

## Getting Started

1. **Search for a book** you've recently read
2. **Start ranking** by comparing it against other books
3. **Watch your list grow** as you add more books
4. **Share your profile** and see how friends compare

The more books you rank, the more accurate and interesting your list becomes. Start with 5-10 books and you'll immediately see the value.

With more book tracking options than ever, choosing the right one matters. Here's an honest look at the three most popular options.

## Goodreads

**The veteran.** Goodreads has the largest community and the most comprehensive book database. It's great if you want to see what everyone is reading and participate in reading challenges.

**Pros:** Huge community, reading challenges, comprehensive database, author pages.

**Cons:** Outdated interface, star ratings feel imprecise, social features are clunky, owned by Amazon which concerns some readers.

## StoryGraph

**The stats nerd.** StoryGraph is built for readers who love data. It tracks your reading moods, pacing preferences, and gives detailed statistics about your reading habits.

**Pros:** Beautiful statistics, mood and pace tracking, no Amazon ownership, good recommendation engine.

**Cons:** Smaller community, still uses star/half-star ratings, less focus on social comparison.

## Bookfolio

**The ranker.** Bookfolio replaces star ratings with head-to-head comparisons. Instead of guessing a number, you compare two books and pick a favorite. The result is a definitive ranked list of every book you've read.

**Pros:** Unique ranking system, visual profiles, direct friend comparison, modern fast interface, actively developed.

**Cons:** Newer platform with a growing community, focused on ranking rather than reading statistics.

## Which Should You Choose?

- **Choose Goodreads** if community size and reading challenges are your priority.
- **Choose StoryGraph** if you love reading statistics and mood tracking.
- **Choose Bookfolio** if you want a definitive ranking of your books and love comparing taste with friends.

Many readers use more than one. But if you've ever struggled to answer "what's your favorite book?" — Bookfolio is the one that will finally give you an answer.
